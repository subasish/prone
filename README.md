## Shiny App for Crash Proneness

This dataset contains the data of `Louisiana Drivers' Crash record` for `seven years (2004-20011)`. The dataset has two major divisions: `at-fault drivers` and `not-at-fault  drivers`. The characteristics of the incidents related to the at-fault and not-at-fault drivers are analyzed in an exploratory way in this app. `Forty four variables` are used for the data analysis.
`Four different interactive plots` can be visible from this app.
